When I first came upon the name *brag document* I didn't even look at it twice, mostly because of the name. But it's basically about identifying what you like doing so that you can do more of that. It's explained very good [here](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork), [here](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) and  [here](https://aashni.me/blog/hype-yourself-youre-worth-it/).
